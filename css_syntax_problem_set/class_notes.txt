Styling the fonts
When using fonts on the web, you must first consider what fonts are available to your users.
Every operating system, be it Windows, OS X, or Linux, comes with a set of pre-installed fonts
that you can use for customizing your website

font-family: font1, font2, font3, ...;

Then, the browser, starting from left to right, looks at the font(s) you've specified and checks to see if it can render the text using the font(s) you've provided.
If it can't use the first font, then the browser moves to the next font, and so-on.

The purpose for specifying multiple fonts is because not all fonts are available on every operating system.
So, specifying multiple, similar fonts ensures users have a consistent experience regardless of the operating system they are using.

Custom Fonts
It is also possible to use custom fonts on the web.
If you want to go ahead and start experimenting, you can check out Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) to see some open-source web fonts in action!
With custom web fonts,
it's not as important to specify multiple fonts like seen above; however, it is still smart to specify at least one backup font in case your custom font doesn't load.


Writing CSS selectors:-
--------------------------
In this, the third in our series of articles on selectors,
we discuss pseudo-selectors.
These don't select elements, but rather certain parts of elements, or elements only in certain contexts.
They come in two main types:
pseudo-classes
----------------
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to the end of a selector, preceded by a colon (:), which is used to specify that you want to style the selected element but only when it is in a certain state.
 For example, you might want to style a link element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox when it is disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.
and
pseudo-elements:-
-------------------
Pseudo-elements are very much like pseudo-classes, but they have differences.
They are keywords, this time preceded by two colons (::), that can be added to the end of selectors to select a certain part of an element.

::after
::before
::first-letter
::first-line
::selection
::backdrop
