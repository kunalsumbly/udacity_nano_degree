Cascading style sheets is all about style
color, spacing , fonts, and layout


If you want to try removing the style from the Youtube homepage yourself, follow these instructions:

Visit https://www.youtube.com/ or any other website of your choice.
Right click anywhere on the page, and click "Inspect" (on Mac) or "Inspect Element" (Firefox)
You'll see a panel showing HTML. Inside the <head> element, delete any line that has rel="stylesheet". For example:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//s.ytimg.com/yts/cssbin/www-core-webp-vflCayM79.css" name="www-core" class="css-httpssytimgcomytscssbinwwwcorewebpvflCayM79css">


Important note !!!!:-
Each browser comes by its own default list of styling and thats is what we need to sometimes reset all the default styles in css before we actually display anything on the webspage.
